# Why I Declined my Google Job Offer

The recruiter's email arrived on a Tuesday. Subject line: "Congratulations from Google." I'd made it through the gauntlet—seven interviews, a coding marathon, a design doc, and enough whiteboard sessions to make my markers run dry. The offer was generous. Very generous. The kind that makes your parents cry happy tears and your LinkedIn explode with congratulations.

I turned it down.

## The Prestige Trap

Here's what nobody tells you about working at a Big Tech company: the prestige is intoxicating. You get to casually drop "I work at Google" at parties. Your Zoom background shows that iconic campus. Every recruiter in a 50-mile radius suddenly wants to be your best friend.

But prestige is a weird drug. It feels good going in, but it doesn't actually change what you do day-to-day. You're still in meetings. You're still debugging someone else's spaghetti code. You're still in a queue behind 47 other engineers to ship a button color change.

And let's be real—after six months, nobody cares anymore. The shine wears off. You're just... working.

## The Robot in the Room

Around the time the offer came through, I'd started tinkering with something that wouldn't leave me alone. Robots. Not the cute vacuum kind. The kind that could actually *do* things. Navigate warehouses. Manipulate objects. Learn from mistakes.

I'd wake up at 3 AM with ideas about how to improve object grasping. I'd sketch motion planning algorithms on napkins during coffee runs. My browser history was a graveyard of arXiv papers and ROS documentation.

Here's the thing about obsession: you can't fake it. You can't manufacture caring about something at 3 AM when nobody's watching. That's when you know it's real.

## The Bet

Declining Google wasn't really about Google. It was about placing a bet.

I could bet on the established path—a well-trodden career ladder, good comp, great resume bullet point. Safe. Predictable. Someone else's vision.

Or I could bet on myself. On the robot idea that kept me up at night. On the belief that the most interesting problems aren't the ones with seven layers of management approval.

I chose the latter.

## What Happened Next

Spoiler alert: it wasn't a smooth ride. Turns out, building ML systems for robots is *hard*. Like, really hard. Sim-to-real transfer makes you question everything you thought you knew about neural networks. Edge cases multiply like rabbits. Your robot bumps into walls for three weeks straight before you realize there's a sign error in your coordinate transformation.

But here's the beautiful part: it was *mine*. Every late night debugging session. Every breakthrough. Every embarrassing failure. I owned all of it.

I built Graphbook because I needed a tool that didn't exist. I published research because I had questions nobody else was asking. I learned more in two years of building my own thing than I would have in five years of optimizing someone else's metrics.

## The Real Lesson

Look, I'm not saying everyone should turn down Google. That would be ridiculous. For many people, it's the perfect move.

But I am saying this: **prestige is not a strategy.**

The question isn't "Where would I be most impressive?" It's "Where would I learn the most?" "Where would I have the most impact?" "What problem can I not stop thinking about?"

Those are harder questions. They don't have clean answers. They require introspection and honesty and a willingness to look silly when you explain your decision at Thanksgiving dinner.

## Today

These days, I'm neck-deep in robotics ML. Some days are brilliant—watching a policy learn to manipulate objects in ways you didn't explicitly program is pure magic. Some days are frustrating—why is the gripper doing that?!

But I wake up excited. I go to bed thinking about tomorrow's experiments. I'm solving problems that matter to me, not because they're assigned, but because I chose them.

That email from Google still sits in my archive. Sometimes I see it and wonder "what if?" But mostly, I see it as a reminder: the scariest decisions often lead to the best stories.

And honestly? I'm having way too much fun with these robots to wonder for long.

*If you're facing a similar decision, my DM's are open. No judgment, just conversation. Sometimes it helps to talk it through with someone who's been there.*

*P.S. - To the Google recruiter who was incredibly gracious about my decision: thank you. You made a tough conversation much easier.*
